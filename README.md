# Pong Challenge
Browser based pong game created for PointClickCare's high school coding challenge. THe challenge was to make a pong game, but challengers were given the freedom to add whatever features they liked. I ended up getting a bit carried away...

The application itself is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Furthermore, unit testing is done through the Jasmine library for JavaScript.

### Tested Environments
- Developed in Ubuntu 16.04, using Google Chrome version 75.0.3770.100
- Tested in Ubuntu 16.04, using Firefox version 67.0.4
- Tested in Windows 1803 Home edition, using Google Chrome version 75.0.3770.100

### Why HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS/jQuery?
- Installing the application does not require any pre-installed environment, as these languages are natively supported by all modern web browsers.
- Running the application is extremely simple
- I have experience designing good-looking frontends for applications using HTML/CSS/related libraries, and believe these languagues and libraries provide a lot more flexibility for this project than my other options (ex. java's jframe or python's pygame)
- Raw HTML, CSS, and JS runs fast
- The canvas HTML object supports all the features I need for game play

### Regrets using JavaScript?
- OOP in JavaScript doesn't feel as robust as in my other options, such as Java
- Sometimes JavaScript's asynchronous ability caused more sources of potential error than help for this type of project

### Why Jasmine for unit testing?
- Jasmine doesn't require a specific user environment to run, unlike most other JS unit testing libraries that require pip and other external libraries
- The syntax was easy to pick up, especially for someone who has never done unit testing before

### Features
- Bot mode
- Auto aim mode
- Multiple power ups
- Fun sound effects
- Easy scalability/program extensions, due to OOP and the concept of encapsulation
